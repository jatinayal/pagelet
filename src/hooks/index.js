/**
 * Hooks Directory
 * ===============
 *
 * This directory contains custom React hooks for the application.
 *
 * Planned hooks:
 * - useAuth.js      → Authentication state and methods (login, logout, user)
 * - useBlocks.js    → Block CRUD operations and state management
 * - useDebounce.js  → Debounce utility for auto-save functionality
 * - usePages.js     → Page list and operations
 *
 * Each hook should:
 * - Be prefixed with 'use' following React conventions
 * - Handle loading and error states where applicable
 * - Be documented with JSDoc comments
 */

// Re-export hooks as they are created
// export { useAuth } from './useAuth';
// export { useBlocks } from './useBlocks';
// export { useDebounce } from './useDebounce';
// export { usePages } from './usePages';
