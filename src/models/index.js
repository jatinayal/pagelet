/**
 * Models Directory
 * ================
 *
 * This directory contains Mongoose schemas for all MongoDB collections.
 *
 * Planned models:
 * - User.js    → User authentication data (email, passwordHash)
 * - Page.js    → Page/document metadata (title, userId, timestamps)
 * - Block.js   → Content blocks within pages (type, content, order)
 *
 * Each model exports:
 * - The Mongoose model
 * - Optionally, helper methods for common operations
 */

// Re-export models as they are created
// export { default as User } from './User';
// export { default as Page } from './Page';
// export { default as Block } from './Block';
